    "description": "A ripe avocado yields to gentle pressure when held in the palm of the hand and squeezed. The fruit is not sweet, but distinctly and subtly flavored, with smooth texture. The avocado is popular in vegetarian cuisine as a substitute for meats in sandwiches and salads because of its high fat content. Generally, avocado is served raw, though some cultivars, including the common 'Hass', can be cooked for a short time without becoming bitter. It is used as the base for the Mexican dip known as guacamole, as well as a spread on corn tortillas or toast, served with spices."

    "description": "Rice has more lysine than wheat, corn and sorghum, and contains large amounts of starch. Clean rice, already devoid of its bran, usually has less dietary fiber than other cereals and is therefore more digestible. It can be a sustenance food and provides higher caloric content and more protein per hectare than wheat and corn. As a general rule, rice is cooked by applying moisture and heat to the grains. The ways of applying heat to rice for cooking are diverse. On some occasions, steam is applied by means of steamers and in this way steam cooking is carried out."

So shrimps are high in cholesterol, but they also contain omega-3 fatty acids that have been shown to promote heart health. Research on shrimp has also shown positive health effects. Shrimps can be prepared as an appetizer or in a dish, like curries or stir-fries. They can be covered in breadcrumbs or cooked on kebab sticks."
